# Grafana panel plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a panel plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana panel plugins?

Panel plugins allow you to add new types of visualizations to your dashboard, such as maps, clocks, pie charts, lists, and more.

Use panel plugins when you want to do things like visualize data returned by data source queries, navigate between dashboards, or control external systems (such as smart home devices).

## Getting started

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev

   # or

   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes
   yarn test
   
   # Exists after running all the tests
   yarn lint:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   yarn server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spin up a Grafana instance first that we tests against 
   yarn server
   
   # Start the tests
   yarn e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   yarn lint
   
   # or

   yarn lint:fix
   ```
